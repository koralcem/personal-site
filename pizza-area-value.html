<h1>Pizza Area Value</h1>

<p>Should you spend a bit more and get the bigger size pizza? Is it worth it?</p>

<p>Neil deGrasse Tyson has <a href="https://x.com/neiltyson/status/162243094258008065">this great quote about the issue</a>. The math obviously checks out, but calculating the area of a circle quickly isn't easy for a lot of people. The Pizza Area Value app lets you input the diameters and prices of two pizza sizes you're considering and get a comparison instantly.</p>
