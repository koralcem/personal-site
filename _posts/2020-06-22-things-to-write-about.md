# Things to write about

These are my answers to the writing prompts given in the great book "642 Things to Write About".

## What can happen in a second

Many things. A heart starts beating. A heart stops beating. Love at first sight. Lust at first sight. A slip, a fall, broken bones. Your concentration vanishing because someone walked into your office. Relief of finding your keys when you're trying to leave in a hurry. Recognizing a friend in a crowd. Registering the first bite of ice cream. Waking up from a bad dream. The cold plunge when you jump into a pool. Adrenaline in your blood when the roller coaster drops. Elation when you hear you got the job.
