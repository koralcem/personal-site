Why do people get weirded out when I donâ€™t shower every day? Or why does buying groceries more than once a week feel odd? Performance reviews once a year? What I do for most of the year will probably be forgotten. Why not more frequently, or aligned with large deliverables and milestones instead of just time. Birthday? Why celebrate one more year of living, really? Why are schools a year with the summers off?

The day is a natural cycle: Light, dark, wake sleep. But the gradations on the clock are arbitrary. Why are work hours 9 - 5? Especially with more and more information work. What if I'm most productive before the kids wake up and after they go to bed? On the other hand, some biological research shows that teenagers naturally fall asleep later and wake up later, yet we enforce a crazy early school schedule on them. California even had to pass a law to get that to stop!

Eating is another such area. Why do we eat only at certain times or only certain foods? What is it about pancakes that doesn't make them suitable to consume after dark?

The year is another natural cycle: the seasons, the weather changing. So when a farmer plants their seeds is natural. But the months and year labels are arbitrary. Why does school go from fall to early summer? Why are the summers off? Can't learning happen in the summer? You won't get that when you work. Birthdays are another weird one. Why celebrate surviving one more rotation of the earth around the sun? Some years there's nothing noteworthy in one's life, and others are full of new experiences and challenges. Yet we're supposed to celebrate both the same. Kids can't wait to get older, and adults don't want to.
