title: "Candy. I do not think it means what you think it means."
---

The OHRF runs the holiday express (https://orhf.org/events/holiday-express/). They give out candy to kids. I get what they're doing; they want you to have a good time so you form fond memories of the ride, trains, etc. but I think it has the exact opposite effect. And I'm not even talking about my anti-sugar soapbox. Let me tell you a story.

We go. It's barely above freezing and raining, but they have a tent. The tent is warm, filled with cool stuff. Info station, souvenirs, various stands. Everyone is reverent. Talking about the steam. In one of stands Mina spins a wheel that has numbers on it. It lands on a 4. An elderly gentleman reads a question "what powers the SP 4449?" Mina guesses "steam" because it's a steam engine. Turns out it's oil, but it's deemed a good guess and he hands her a piece of taffy.

Big mistake. Mina wants to eat the candy. I say no and a mini argument ensues. We never even make it to the souvenirs.

We manage to calm down by the time we're entering the train. The kids are marveling at the old cars and how they're decorated for Christmas. They find a seat and settle down. The lurch of the wheels is exiciting and the scenery starts rolling by. Kids have their noses to the window. Wave to the biker on the path next to us. Ducks are diving in the pond. Volunteers are telling stories about how the old lines used to run. Sone of them actually rode the thing when it was in commission. Then Santa comes by and hands out candy canes.

Another big mistake. Kids are now in two groups. They are either staring cross-eyed at the tip of their candy canes. It's amazing how you can suck off the red lines. Another group is arguing with their parents about why they can't eat their candy canes _now_. I denied the taffy earlier so by now resistance is futile. My daughter joins the former group. The entire second half of the ride passes like this. The adults even spot deer out the window and try to point it out to the kids. Some kids half-heartedly turn their head before whipping it back to the candy. Some don't even bother -- they're honest about their priorities.

When we get home, mama asks "Did you have fun?". "YEAH" shouts Mina and we're all a bit excited that she had a good time. "they gave us taffy and a candy cane. Oooh, can I have the taffy now? Pleasepleaseplease?". Sigh...
