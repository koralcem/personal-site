<p>
  Thank you very much for reaching out with a new opportunity. I'm always interested in hearing about them. That said, I have two priorities you should be aware of.
</p>

<ol>
  <li>Is the position fully remote?
    <ul>
      <li>"Fully remote" means I can work from home (or wherever I want) permanently. No relocation or commuting is expected. And this should be the case even after this global pandemic is settled.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Is the position focused on native Apple platform development?
    <ul>
      <li>My definition of "native Apple platform development" is building iOS, iPadOS, macOS, watchOS or tvOS apps using Swift or Objective-C. If the job description includes cross-platform solutions like "React Native", "Electron", "Cordova", "Capacitor", et al. the answer to this question is "No", even though those can still result in apps for Apple platforms.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>
  If the answer to <em>either</em> question above is "No", I'm not interested. I'm sure the company and the position are both great. But I'm not willing to give up the flexibility of remote work. And my career goal is to become an expert on Apple platforms, so I'm looking for opportunities that involve working with them. I wish you the best of luck in your talent search.
</p>

<p>
  If the answer to <em>both</em> of the questions above is "Yes", then I'd love to hear a bit more about the opportunity. Can you send me a message that answers the following questions?
</p>

<ol>
  <li>What does the company do? What problem are they solving? You're welcome to skip this bit if it's an obviously world-renowned company.</li>
  <li>How does the company make money? Who are the customers? What do they actually pay for?</li>
  <li>What would I be doing in this specific position? Please don't assume a title (e.g. "iOS Engineer") makes it obvious. For instance, some companies have multiple products. If this is the case, which one would I be working on? Or sometimes a single product is so large that multiple teams work on it. If so, which part of the product would I be tackling?</li>
  <li>What is the salary range for this position? Are there other significant parts of the compensation package (bonus, stock, etc.)?</li>
</ol>
