  Thank you very much for reaching out with a new opportunity. I'm always interested in hearing about them. That said, I have some priorities you should be aware of.
</p>

<ol>
  <li>Is the position fully remote?
    <ul>
      <li>"Fully remote" means I can work from home (or wherever I want) permanently. No relocation, commuting, or otherwise going to an office is ever expected.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Is the position focused on native Apple platform development?
    <ul>
      <li>This means building iOS, iPadOS, watchOS, macOS or tvOS apps using Swift. If the job description includes cross-platform solutions like "React Native", "Electron", "Cordova", "Capacitor", et al. the answer to this question is "No". If I'd need to spend any time on other platforms like Android or Windows the answer is also "No".</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Is it a full-time position (i.e. not part-time, and not a contract)?
  </li>
  <li>My work day can't start earlier than 8:30 AM US Pacific Time. Is that acceptable?
    <ul>
      <li>My wife leaves early for work, so I have to drop off our daughter at school. By the time I get back and online it's around 8:30 AM.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>
  If the answer to <em>any</em> question above is "No", I'm not interested. I'm sure the company and the position are both great. But I'm not willing to give up the flexibility of remote work. My career goal is to become an expert on Apple platforms, so I'm looking for opportunities that involve working with them. I might be interested in some contract positions in the future but I currently can't afford the risk of the employer deciding to not renew my contract and having to scramble to find something else. And I'm not willing to give up my time with our daughter in the mornings. I wish you the best of luck in your talent search.
</p>

<p>
  If the answer to <em>all</em> questions above are "Yes", then I'd love to hear a bit more about the opportunity. Can you send me a message that answers the following questions? I realize your initial message might have covered some of these, but please bear with me.
</p>

<ol>
  <li>What does the company do? What problem are they solving? You're welcome to skip this bit if it's an obviously world-renowned company.</li>
  <li>How does the company make money? Who are the customers and what do they actually pay for? If the company doesn't make money yet, what are the plans to eventually bring in revenue?</li>
  <li>Is the company profitable? If not, how much cash do they have on hand? What is the current burn rate and runway?</li>
  <li>What would I be doing in this specific position? Please don't assume a title (e.g. "iOS Engineer") makes it obvious. For instance, some companies have multiple products. If this is the case, which one would I be working on? Or sometimes a single product is so large that multiple teams work on it. If so, which part of the product would I be tackling?</li>
  <li>What is the salary range for this position? Are there other significant parts of the compensation package (bonus, stock, etc.)?</li>
  <li>How many vacation days (or other paid time off) do employees get? How many paid holidays does the company observe?</li>
</ol>

<p>
  At this point some people respond with "Let's hop on a call and I can answer all your questions!" or "You can read more about us here". I'm sure such statements are correct. Unfortunately I don't have enough time to hop on a call or do research about every interesting opportunity. So if you want me to consider your position, I must insist the next step be a written message which answers my questions above. I realize this sounds entitled and I'm so sorry about that. But you may not hear back from me until I receive such a message.
