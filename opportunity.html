<p>
  Thank you very much for reaching out with a new opportunity. I'm always interested in hearing about them. That said, I have two priorities you should be aware of.
</p>

<ol>
  <li>Is the position fully remote?
    <ul>
      <li>"Fully remote" means I can work from home (or wherever I want) permanently. No relocation is expected. Even if the company has a presence in Portland, OR no commuting is expected. And this should be the case even after this global pandemic is settled.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Is the position focused on native Apple platform development?
    <ul>
      <li>My definition of "native Apple platform development" is building iOS, iPadOS, macOS, watchOS or tvOS apps using Swift or Objective-C. If the job description includes cross-platform solutions like "React Native", "Electron", "Cordova", "Capacitor", et al. the answer to this question is "No", even though those can still result in apps for Apple platforms. If I'd need to spend any time other platforms like Android or Windows the answer is also "No".</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Is it a full-time position (i.e. not part-time, and not a contract)?
  </li>
  <li>My work day can start at 8:15 am US Pacific Time. Is that acceptable?
    <ul>
      <li>My wife leaves early for work, so I have to drop off our daughter at school. By the time I get back and online it's around 8:15 am. This has come up as a sticking point with some companies. For instance, the company is hiring remotely since the pandemic but almost all existing employees are on the east coast. And they have early morning standup meetings that the whole team is expected to attend. Yet an early meeting for someone on the east coast is way too early for us on the west coast.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>
  If the answer to <em>any</em> question above is "No", I'm not interested. I'm sure the company and the position are both great. But I'm not willing to give up the flexibility of remote work. My career goal is to become an expert on Apple platforms, so I'm looking for opportunities that involve working with them. I might be interested in some contract positions in the future but I currently can't afford the risk of the employer deciding to not renew my contract and having to scramble to find something else. And I'm not willing to give up my time with my daughter in the mornings. I wish you the best of luck in your talent search.
</p>

<p>
  If the answer to <em>all</em> questions above are "Yes", then I'd love to hear a bit more about the opportunity. Can you send me a message that answers the following questions?
</p>

<ol>
  <li>What does the company do? What problem are they solving? You're welcome to skip this bit if it's an obviously world-renowned company.</li>
  <li>How does the company make money? Who are the customers? What do they actually pay for?</li>
  <li>What would I be doing in this specific position? Please don't assume a title (e.g. "iOS Engineer") makes it obvious. For instance, some companies have multiple products. If this is the case, which one would I be working on? Or sometimes a single product is so large that multiple teams work on it. If so, which part of the product would I be tackling?</li>
  <li>What is the salary range for this position? Are there other significant parts of the compensation package (bonus, stock, etc.)?</li>
  <li>How much vacation or paid time off does the company provide?</li>
</ol>
