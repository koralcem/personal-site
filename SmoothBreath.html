	<p>Smooth Breath was born out of my desire to... just breathe. There are a lot of breathing and relaxation apps available but they all have many bells & whistles. I don't want to answer questions about my mood before I begin, keep a streak going, or watch forests in the background. I want to just set a rhythm and breathe. I couldn't find such an app so I made it. Sadly, the name "Just Breathe" was already taken.</p>
	
	<p>Though the app is simple, building and releasing it gave me experience with a range of iOS development concepts: Swift, controls, views, view controllers, animations, storing & retrieving user preferences, iTunes Connect, beta testing via TestFlight, and the app review process.</p>
	
	<p>The app icon was made by my good friend <a href="http://onurvural.com/">Onur Vural.</a></p>
