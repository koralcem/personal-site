<h1>Burgle Bros Tracker</h1>

<p>Burgle Bros Tracker is a companion app to the great board game <a href="https://www.fowers.games/collections/direct-price/products/burgle-bros">Burgle Bros</a> by <a href="https://www.fowers.games/">Fowers Games</a>.</p>

<p>The game provides a reference card showing how many of each tile is in the game. At any point you can count up the tiles you've explored so far, compare them with the reference card, and try to guess what the next tile you turn over will be. Similarly, you can look through the discarded patrol cards for each floor to deduce where the guard will go next.</p>

<p>But counting tiles each time you want to guess at the next one is tedious. So is laying out all the discarded patrol cards when planning your next move. Burgle Bros Tracker enables you to easily track all of this. Spend less time counting tiles, and more time enjoying the challenging game and the company of your friends.</p>

<p>Keeping track of this information isn't against the rules. It's even encouraged in the handbook! So this app won't spoil any of the challenge. It just makes a valid strategy simpler.</p>

<p>In case it's not obvious, Burgle Bros Tracker is not developed by or otherwise associated with Fowers Games.</p>
